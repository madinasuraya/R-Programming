## Modeling Hospital Stay Duration and Readmission Risk in Diabetic Patients Using Machine Learning 🏥 💊

Hospital readmissions and prolonged lengths of stay are critical challenges in managing diabetes-related hospital care. Frequent readmissions can indicate poor disease management, while extend hospitalizations strain healthcare resources and increase patient risk. Leveraging machine learning (ML) to predict these outcomes can help identify high-risk patients early, guide interventions, and improve care planning.

This project focuses on predicting two important outcomes among diabetic patients:

1. The duration of hospital stays, a continuous variable representing healthcare utilization.
2. The prediction of readmission, a classification problem that reflects care quality.

By analyzing clinical, demographic, and treatment-related features, the project applies predictive modeling and interpretability techniques to uncover key drivers of these outcomes and enhance decision support in diabetes care.
